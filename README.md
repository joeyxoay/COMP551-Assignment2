### Background: 
This mini-project involves the implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for image classification, offering practical experience in building neural networks and experimenting with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using pre-trained models.

### Task 1: Data Acquisition: 
The first task is to acquire two image datasets, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10, with the help of libraries like PyTorch. Data are loaded, vectorized, and normalized for further processing.

### Task 2: MLP Implementation: 
A custom MLP needs to be built from scratch, which includes backpropagation and the implementation of mini-batch gradient descent, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). 

### Task 3: Experiments and Reporting: 
The main goal of this phase is to explore critical decisions during training. Mandatory experiments cover various aspects, including weight initialization, network architecture, activation functions, regularization, unnormalized images, and comparing MLPs to CNNs on two datasets.
